# The Scratch application 

Application is a database that contains information about winning scratch cards in the United Kingdom. It allows users to input their scratch card selections and provides predictions on their chances of winning based on the data stored. 

### However, users should be aware that the predictions may not accurately reflect reality due to the potential for inaccurate or unreliable information entered by other users. 

The application is built using the React library and Firebase database.

## Technology

I used the React library and Firebase to develop the application. This allowed me to save data and provide users with a simple way to log in to the app.
