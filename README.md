# The Scratch application 

This application is a database that stores information about winning scratch cards in the United Kingdom. Users can input their scratch card selections, and the application provides predictions on their chances of winning based on the data it has collected.

### Users should be aware that the predictions may not accurately reflect reality, as the information entered by other users could be inaccurate or unreliable.

This application was developed using the React JavaScript library and the Firebase cloud-based database platform.
